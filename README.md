This repository is just a container (including input/output files) for the notebook `FullAnalysis_ABDorA-C`.

This notebook presents a full re-analysis of the data presented in [Azulay et al. (2017), A&A, 607, A10](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017A&A...607A..10A/abstract) (thereafter Az17) for the binary system AB Dor A/C, using a Bayesian approach. In this version, all the needed functions are defined in the notebook. We will do the full analysis, running the MCMC calculation and doing the analysis of the resulting chain a posteriori. I also include in this notebook a detailed description of the model used.

The model used in the fit/analysis is based on the definitions of [Wright & Howard (2009), ApJSS, 182:202-215](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2009ApJS..182..205W/abstract), thereafter WH09.
